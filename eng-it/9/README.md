Tell me about yourself
I’d describe myself as a goal-oriented and hardworking person with good organizational skills and strategic thinking.

Furthermore, I’m a good speaker and even a better listener — that’s why I’ve always been able to get along with different types of people. I have over six years of experience in sales. After working the past four years as a sales manager, I’ve developed a number of important skills, including decision-making and multitasking. That background will help me achieve all goals you have set for this position.

In my free time I enjoy reading and bicycling. It provides me with a good balance in my life.

What are your strengths?
My strengths are excellent written and verbal communication skills. I can usually win people over to my point of view. Also, I’m competitive and like to excel at everything I do. My goal is to achieve results beyond the expectations of my supervisor. And last but not least, I’m very flexible and adaptable to new situations. Regardless of the situation I have the ability to adapt and work under any circumstances. These skills seem to be directly related to the job.

What are your weaknesses?
I admit being a bit of a perfectionist. Sometimes when I’m working on a big project, I focus too much on the details. But I’ve learned that it’s not always possible or even practical to try to perfect your work.
